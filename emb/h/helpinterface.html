    And it will take a very long time indeed to compile a index for something like Cassius Dio's <span class="italic">Historiae Romanae</span>.
    Then again, how long would it take to do this by hand? As with the browser and text maker, the index
    maker is sensitive to the details of your selections: it will make an index of a genre, multiple authors,
    a single author, a whole work, or any arbitrary subdivision of a work all the way down (somewhat comically) to an
    individual line. </p>
